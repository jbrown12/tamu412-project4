    class=\"details\"><div class=\"vtbegenerated\"><p>For this project, you will use
    the same four groups from Project #1, with the change that we will no longer be
    split into Dev or Ops teams (just Team A, Team B, Team C, and Team D). The goal
    of this project is to practice the workflow of social coding â€” learning to collaborate
    within a group on a common set of data. Each team will deliver a simple website
    that is hosted on Github.com using the Github Pages service. Github Pages is typically
    used to host an informational website about a technical project; in this case,
    there is no technical project behind the website, but you can just write a placeholder
    file (like a<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><code><b>README</b></code><span
    class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>file) to have something in the<span
    class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><code>master</code>branch.</p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><div

    PROJECT #3: Building an app in Ruby</h3></div><div class=\"details\"><div class=\"vtbegenerated\"><p></p><p>The
    goal of this project is to familiarize yourself with Ruby syntax, and some basic
    tasks that are common in systems programming and administration. The program will
    be invoked from the command line on a fresh Linux machine, so if you introduce
    any library dependencies beyond the Ruby Standard Library (<em><strong>not recommended</strong></em>),
    you must provide<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><em>very</em><span
    class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>clear instructions to recreate your
    environment. I would suggest using<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><strong>vagrant</strong><span
    class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>to develop in Linux if you are on
    a Windows machine. It is your responsibility to ensure the program runs as expected
    in the operational environment described. </p></div></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div
